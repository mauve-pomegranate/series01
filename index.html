He becomes entangled in the supernatural mystery surrounding Yume Minamoto. His journey involves developing Ætheric sensitivity (manifesting as migraines, premonitions, and altered perceptions), being guided by cryptic clues and supernatural entities (like Mr. Whispers and the tabby cats), forming alliances, and eventually being \"split\" into two versions due to the Ikanajima incident.</p><p><strong>Key Traits:</strong> Observant, determined, develops empathy and a strong sense of responsibility. Susceptible to migraines linked to Ætheric sensitivity, which are often accompanied by seeing blue sparks, smelling ozone, and feeling reverberations in dental fillings. Resourceful but often out of his depth in purely magical situations. Prone to internal monologues of confusion and resolve.</p><p><strong>Motivations (Deeper):</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Search for Belonging/Purpose:</strong> Escaped NAR, but Japan is still alien. The investigation gives him a role, a sense of meaning. This deepens as he uncovers cosmic stakes.</li><li><strong>Innate Justice/Empathy:</strong> Despite his initial reluctance, he's genuinely moved by Yume's plight and later by the sacrifices of others. He can't stand by.</li><li><strong>Visa Security/Fear of NAR:</strong> A primary driver in Book 1 is to keep his job to renew his visa and avoid returning to the harsh realities of the NAR. Guilt over leaving his sister Carly behind.</li><li><strong>Understanding Self (Post-Split):</strong> In Book 3, his primary internal drive is to understand his fractured nature, the loss of his \"other half,\" and what it means to be \"whole.\" To honor NAR-Bowie's sacrifice by living fully. The epilogue of Book 1 (Kurai's message, the video, the headache) plants a seed of deep unease and a sense of \"wrongness\" or missing pieces. In Book 3, this manifests as an inexplicable pull, a feeling of Déjà vu, and a need to understand the fragmented \"memories\" or feelings that surface. Carly's arrival and the subsequent revelations from Sakura/Mizuki/Shikako then give this underlying drive a concrete focus. His faith isn't in his own ability initially, but in the undeniable reality of what Carly represents (a link to a lost part of himself) and the gravity of the new threat. The re-merging then solidifies his purpose with the full weight of both selves' experiences.</li><li><strong>Confronting Trauma:</strong> His migraines are a physical manifestation of his unprocessed Ætheric sensitivity and trauma. His journey is partly about learning to manage or integrate this.</li></ul><p><strong>Book Arcs:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Book 1 (Fate and Foxfire):</strong> Tasked by his boss to find missing client services agent Yume Minamoto to secure his visa renewal. Follows a trail of cryptic clues (katakana characters ル, ト, パ forming \"Tulpa\"; Yume's bus ticket; shrine guestbook) often guided by a trio of synchronized tabby cats and the enigmatic Mr. Whispers. Encounters Mizuki, who is also investigating disappearances. They team up, acquiring artifacts (scrying mirror, painter's journal, agate necklace, metal box with key). Attempts a ritual from the painter's journal to save Yume from the Æther, accessed via a portal under the Watanabe Park fountain, but only partially succeeds as Yume is pulled back by purple hands and the Hierophant card anchor rips. Travels to Ikanajima Island. Enters the Kozyrev Mirror to try and stabilize the collapsing reality, leading to his \"splitting\" and subsequent memory wipe by Mizuki/Hisoka. Receives an encrypted message from \"K\" (Kurai) in the epilogue, showing CCTV footage of him with Yume, triggering a migraine and Déjà vu.</li><li><strong>Book 2 (Family and Folklore - NAR-Bowie):</strong> A \"split\" version in the NAR, a product of its harsh environment. Found in a stasis pod. Sacrifices himself to save Carly.</li><li><strong>Book 3 (Faith and Finality - Japan-Bowie):</strong> Original Bowie, memories wiped. Lives a seemingly normal life until Carly finds him. Must confront his fractured nature and his role in the new cosmic threat (Koda). Potentially re-merges with his other half on Ikanajima.</li></ul><p><strong>Relationships:</strong> Mizuki/Hisoka (complex alliance, protection, wiped memories), Yume/Sakura (initial case, rescue attempts), Carly Shepard (sister, source of guilt and motivation to stay out of NAR), Mr. Whispers (enigmatic guide), Akihiko Saito (Mobex contact), Zed (antique dealer).</p> ",

He perceives reality as an endless, meaningless time loop—a cosmic prison of repeating suffering.

From a young age, he faced potential discrimination due to his ethnicity. He was Japanese-born, but as his parents were Korean, he was ostracized. When he was of age, he joined the Yako Syndicate, which was more open to those of mixed heritage due to its criminal underpinnings. Even within that organization, he again hit a glass ceiling. Decades of resentment and prejudice, Colt used his contacts and influence within the Yako Syndicate to gain leverage with politicians, police, and other megacorps. Within Yako, he was known as the man that would never say no, taking on jobs that others would either find beneath them or too cruel even for a criminal organization. Finally ascending to a commander within the organization, he knew that he would never be able to have a seat at the table with the board members due to his Zainichi lineage. Cruel/brutal. Driven obsessively to gain more power.</p><p><strong>Actions (Book 1 Context):</strong> When Mobex is being investigated by Shikako, Aoi, Mizuki, Bowie, and others, Colt seizes the opportunity for personal gain to leak critical information. As the protagonists get closer to revealing all of the details, Colt works with Yako elite to advance the timeline for Shinigari/Kirin. Thanks to being overzealous in trying to play both sides, Colt is exposed and while on the island, sacrifices himself (to aid the protagonists) rather than face retribution for betraying Yako.

Initially driven by a journalistic desire to expose corporate malfeasance, Kurai finds herself unwillingly thrust into a hidden world of supernatural phenomena as she develops profound Ætheric sensitivity. This sensitivity manifests as increasingly vivid and physically taxing visions, involuntary journeys into the Æther, and an unnerving ability to perceive and sometimes influence events beyond the mundane. Identified by the enigmatic, masked entity known as the Harbinger as a \"catalyst\" in a looming cosmic conflict involving ancient prophecies and reality-bending entities, Kurai grapples with fear, confusion, and the immense implications of her newfound abilities. Despite her initial reluctance and the dangers involved, she demonstrates a growing resilience and a deep-seated desire to understand the truth, ultimately taking action to aid others caught in the crossfire.</p><p><strong>Key Traits:</strong></p><ul><li>Investigative, inquisitive, and dedicated to uncovering hidden truths.</li><li>Initially prone to significant anxiety, fear, and self-doubt regarding her emerging Ætheric abilities.</li><li>Highly perceptive and empathetic, particularly towards those she senses are in distress (e.g., Yume).</li><li>Resilient and courageous, pushing through terrifying experiences to seek understanding and help.</li><li>Experiences physical and mental distress as a side effect of her Ætheric sensitivity (migraine-like symptoms, nausea, disorientation, temporary paralysis/loss of self).</li><li>Develops a stronger sense of purpose and agency as she begins to accept and understand her role.</li><li>Loyal to her partner, Takuma.</li></ul><p><strong>Motivations (Deeper):</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Uncovering Truth & Exposing Injustice:</strong> Her core journalistic drive is to shed light on conspiracies and wrongdoing, particularly by powerful corporations like Kagami Tenko.</li><li><strong>Understanding Her Own Nature:</strong> As her Ætheric sensitivity intensifies, a primary internal drive becomes the desperate need to understand what is happening to her, why she's having these visions, and what her connection to the Æther signifies. This is a journey for both sanity and identity.</li><li><strong>The Reluctant Catalyst:</strong> The Harbinger's pronouncements that she is a \"catalyst\" and that her involvement is \"not voluntary\" place a heavy, initially unwanted, burden of responsibility on her. She doesn't seek this role but is drawn into it.</li><li><strong>Innate Empathy & Desire to Help:</strong> Despite her fear, her ability to sense Yume's plight and her instinctive action to channel energy to aid her suggest a deep-seated compassion and a desire to use her abilities for good, even before fully understanding them.</li><li><strong>Protecting Others (Emerging):</strong> Her decision with Takuma to expose the dangerous truths they've uncovered, and her act of sending crucial information to Bowie, indicate a growing motivation to protect others from the forces she's encountered.</li></ul><p><strong>Book Arc (Fate and Foxfire):</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Initial Investigations & Unease (Bronze, Expansion):</strong> Begins by investigating Kagami Tenko with Takuma, focusing on corporate espionage angles. She detects anomalous energy readings (e.g., Watanabe Park) that hint at something beyond the mundane, causing her initial unease. Takuma finds evidence of Shikako's infiltration.</li><li><strong>Ætheric Awakening & Harbinger's Warnings (Pink, Green, Emergence):</strong> Kurai experiences a dramatic escalation of her Ætheric sensitivity, including vivid, disorienting visions (shattered prisms, lush but decaying forests, cold white rooms, prismatic infinitely expanding rooms) and involuntary projections into the Æther. She has multiple encounters with the Harbinger, who reveals her significance as a \"catalyst\" and warns of the Yako Syndicate, the Convergence, and the Kirin. These experiences are terrifying, physically debilitating, and leave her questioning her sanity.</li><li><strong>Intervention and Ætheric Connection (White):</strong> Though not physically present at Ikanajima, Kurai feels the planetary vibrations from the Tsunagari event. She has a powerful vision of Bowie's attempt to rescue Yume from the Æther and instinctively channels her own Ætheric energy towards Yume, declaring, \"I helped her. She’s free now, and she’s anchored.\" This marks a critical turning point in her unconscious acceptance and use of her abilities. She also has a disturbing encounter with a faceless version of the Harbinger.</li><li><strong>Resolve to Act & Informing Bowie (White, Epilogue):</strong> Profoundly affected by her experiences, Kurai and Takuma make the decision to expose the dangerous truths they've encountered. Taking on the moniker \"K,\" Kurai (with Takuma's support and potentially Aoi's technical assistance for anonymization) compiles and sends an encrypted package of information—Mobex organizational charts, shell company details, and crucial CCTV footage of Bowie with Yume Minamoto—to Bowie.
