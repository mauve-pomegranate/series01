One of only 33 decks \"gifted by the source.\" This \"source\" could be an ancient, high-ranking <a href=\"#/search/Kitsune (Fox Spirits)\" class=\"internal-link\">Kitsune</a> Celestial, an entity from a higher-order reality, or a collective consciousness of mystics. Each card was likely hand-crafted or metaphysically imbued.</p><br><p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Backs are dark indigo with an intricate looping symbol (original). Yume's version has lilac backs.</p><br><p><strong>Purpose & Power:</strong> Designed as powerful tools for divination and interdimensional manipulation/anchoring. The Hierophant Card is particularly potent as an anchor/bridge between realities. Its ripping signifies a broken connection or immense strain. <a href=\"#/search/Mizuki / Hisoka\" class=\"internal-link\">Mizuki</a> later gives Bowie Yume's Hierophant card, which she acquired via a swap in the <a href=\"#/search/The Æther\" class=\"internal-link\">Æther</a>.</p>"
