            "content": "<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong></p><ul><li>American/Caucasian/White Man</li><li>Early 30’s</li><li>5’11”</li><li>Average build</li><li>Light brown hair, that should be styled, but often is not</li><li>Eye color: Hazel</li><li>Scar on chest from knife (hence the name \"Bowie\")</li><li>Business casual dress: dress/button shirts with dark jeans, leather boots</li><li>Accessories: Watch</li></ul><p><strong>Overview:</strong> An American expatriate in Tokyo, working for a <a href=\"#/search/Mobex Corporation\" class=\"internal-link\">Mobex</a> shell company to maintain his work visa and avoid returning to the <a href=\"#/search/New American Republic (NAR)\" class=\"internal-link\">New American Republic (NAR)</a> where his sister <a href=\"#/search/Carly Shepard\" class=\"internal-link\">Carly</a> resides. He becomes entangled in the supernatural mystery surrounding <a href=\"#/search/Yume Minamoto / Sakura\" class=\"internal-link\">Yume Minamoto</a>. His journey involves developing Ætheric sensitivity (manifesting as migraines, premonitions, and altered perceptions), being guided by cryptic clues and supernatural entities (like <a href=\"#/search/Mr. Whispers\" class=\"internal-link\">Mr. Whispers</a> and the <a href=\"#/search/Kitty Coalition\" class=\"internal-link\">tabby cats</a>), forming alliances, and eventually being \"split\" into two versions due to the Ikanajima incident.</p><p><strong>Key Traits:</strong> Observant, determined, develops empathy and a strong sense of responsibility. Susceptible to migraines linked to Ætheric sensitivity, which are often accompanied by seeing blue sparks, smelling ozone, and feeling reverberations in dental fillings. Resourceful but often out of his depth in purely magical situations. Prone to internal monologues of confusion and resolve.</p><p><strong>Motivations (Deeper):</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Search for Belonging/Purpose:</strong> Escaped NAR, but Japan is still alien. The investigation gives him a role, a sense of meaning. This deepens as he uncovers cosmic stakes.</li><li><strong>Innate Justice/Empathy:</strong> Despite his initial reluctance, he's genuinely moved by Yume's plight and later by the sacrifices of others. He can't stand by.</li><li><strong>Visa Security/Fear of NAR:</strong> A primary driver in Book 1 is to keep his job to renew his visa and avoid returning to the harsh realities of the NAR. Guilt over leaving his sister Carly behind.</li><li><strong>Understanding Self (Post-Split):</strong> In Book 3, his primary internal drive is to understand his fractured nature, the loss of his \"other half,\" and what it means to be \"whole.\" To honor NAR-Bowie's sacrifice by living fully. The epilogue of Book 1 (<a href=\"#/search/Kurai\" class=\"internal-link\">Kurai's</a> message, the video, the headache) plants a seed of deep unease and a sense of \"wrongness\" or missing pieces. In Book 3, this manifests as an inexplicable pull, a feeling of Déjà vu, and a need to understand the fragmented \"memories\" or feelings that surface. Carly's arrival and the subsequent revelations from <a href=\"#/search/Sakura\" class=\"internal-link\">Sakura</a>/<a href=\"#/search/Mizuki / Hisoka\" class=\"internal-link\">Mizuki</a>/<a href=\"#/search/Shikako ('Onryō')\" class=\"internal-link\">Shikako</a> then give this underlying drive a concrete focus. His faith isn't in his own ability initially, but in the undeniable reality of what Carly represents (a link to a lost part of himself) and the gravity of the new threat. The re-merging then solidifies his purpose with the full weight of both selves' experiences.</li><li><strong>Confronting Trauma:</strong> His migraines are a physical manifestation of his unprocessed Ætheric sensitivity and trauma. His journey is partly about learning to manage or integrate this.</li></ul><p><strong>Book Arcs:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Book 1 (Fate and Foxfire):</strong> Tasked by his boss to find missing client services agent Yume Minamoto to secure his visa renewal. Follows a trail of cryptic clues (katakana characters ル, ト, パ forming \"Tulpa\"; Yume's bus ticket; shrine guestbook) often guided by a trio of synchronized tabby cats and the enigmatic Mr. Whispers. Encounters Mizuki, who is also investigating disappearances. They team up, acquiring artifacts (<a href=\"#/search/Scrying Mirror\" class=\"internal-link\">scrying mirror</a>, <a href=\"#/search/Painter's Journal\" class=\"internal-link\">painter's journal</a>, <a href=\"#/search/Agate 'Key' Necklace\" class=\"internal-link\">agate necklace</a>, metal box with key). Attempts a ritual from the painter's journal to save Yume from the <a href=\"#/search/The Æther\" class=\"internal-link\">Æther</a>, accessed via a portal under the <a href=\"#/search/Watanabe Park\" class=\"internal-link\">Watanabe Park</a> fountain, but only partially succeeds as Yume is pulled back by <a href=\"#/search/Purple Hands\" class=\"internal-link\">purple hands</a> and the Hierophant card anchor rips. Travels to <a href=\"#/search/Ikanajima Island\" class=\"internal-link\">Ikanajima Island</a>. Enters the <a href=\"#/search/Kozyrev Mirror\" class=\"internal-link\">Kozyrev Mirror</a> to try and stabilize the collapsing reality, leading to his \"splitting\" and subsequent memory wipe by Mizuki/Hisoka. Receives an encrypted message from \"K\" (<a href=\"#/search/Kurai\" class=\"internal-link\">Kurai</a>) in the epilogue, showing CCTV footage of him with Yume, triggering a migraine and Déjà vu.</li><li><strong>Book 2 (Family and Folklore - NAR-Bowie):</strong> A \"split\" version in the NAR, a product of its harsh environment. Found in a <a href=\"#/search/Stasis Pods\" class=\"internal-link\">stasis pod</a>. Sacrifices himself to save Carly.</li><li><strong>Book 3 (Faith and Finality - Japan-Bowie):</strong> Original Bowie, memories wiped. Lives a seemingly normal life until Carly finds him. Must confront his fractured nature and his role in the new cosmic threat (<a href=\"#/search/Koda\" class=\"internal-link\">Koda</a>). Potentially re-merges with his other half on Ikanajima.</li></ul><p><strong>Relationships:</strong> <a href=\"#/search/Mizuki / Hisoka\" class=\"internal-link\">Mizuki/Hisoka</a> (complex alliance, protection, wiped memories), <a href=\"#/search/Yume Minamoto / Sakura\" class=\"internal-link\">Yume/Sakura</a> (initial case, rescue attempts), <a href=\"#/search/Carly Shepard\" class=\"internal-link\">Carly Shepard</a> (sister, source of guilt and motivation to stay out of NAR), <a href=\"#/search/Mr. Whispers\" class=\"internal-link\">Mr. Whispers</a> (enigmatic guide), <a href=\"#/search/Akihiko Saito\" class=\"internal-link\">Akihiko Saito</a> (Mobex contact), <a href=\"#/search/Zed\" class=\"internal-link\">Zed</a> (antique dealer).</p>",

Even within that organization, he again hit a glass ceiling.
