Is it timeline divergence, soul fragmentation, or a quantum superposition resolving into two distinct entities in different realities?</p><br><p><strong>A (Working Theory):</strong> Not a clean duplication. The Kozyrev Mirror event combined with the Ikanajima nexus collapse didn't copy Bowie, but fractured his singular essence/timeline across a dimensional fault line. Japan-Bowie represents the primary consciousness stream, but with memories of the traumatic event excised by <a href=\"#/search/Mizuki / Hisoka\" class=\"internal-link\">Mizuki</a>. NAR-Bowie represents a significant portion of Bowie's essence/life force shunted into the NAR reality, anchored by his connection to <a href=\"#/search/Carly Shepard\" class=\"internal-link\">Carly</a>. The re-merging is a healing of this metaphysical wound.</p>"

            "content": "<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the upper limits of kitsune abilities (foxfire, phasing, memory alteration)? What are the consequences for breaking their Vows?</p><br><p><strong>A (Working Theory):</strong> Advanced powers like memory alteration are extremely rare and draining, likely unique to <a href=\"#/search/Mizuki / Hisoka\" class=\"internal-link\">Hisoka's</a> lineage. The number of tails correlates to power/mastery. Breaking the Vows of the <a href=\"#/search/Celestial Council\" class=\"internal-link\">Celestial Council</a> could lead to loss of power, exile, or other severe metaphysical consequences.</p>"

Why do some rituals work and others fail?</p><br><p><strong>A (Working Theory):</strong> Characters from linear time perceive the Æther chaotically. Anchors (like the Hierophant card or the agate necklace) are crucial for stabilizing one's perception and grounding rituals in a specific reality. Ritual success depends on the practitioner's skill, the power of components, local Ætheric conditions, and any opposing forces.</p>"

How are they destroyed?</p><br><p><strong>A (Working Theory):</strong> Creation requires immense collective belief or a technological/Ætheric catalyst (<a href=\"#/search/Mobex Corporation\" class=\"internal-link\">Mobex</a> projects). They are anchored to reality by this belief or energy source. They can be \"unmade\" if their conceptual anchor is destroyed or their energy source is cut off. The merging of <a href=\"#/search/Yume Minamoto / Sakura\" class=\"internal-link\">Yume</a> and <a href=\"#/search/Sakura\" class=\"internal-link\">Sakura</a> was a completion or re-integration of a replicated being with its original source.</p>"

What makes a host \"compatible\"?</p><br><p><strong>A (Working Theory):</strong> An ancient, highly advanced <a href=\"#/search/Egregore\" class=\"internal-link\">Egregore</a>. Host compatibility is likely tied to a unique Ætheric signature, genetic markers for high sensitivity, or a specific lineage. <a href=\"#/search/Yume Minamoto / Sakura\" class=\"internal-link\">Yume</a> and <a href=\"#/search/Mizuki / Hisoka\" class=\"internal-link\">Mizuki</a> were prime candidates.</p>"

His power may come from the Void itself, or the \"<a href=\"#/search/Koda (The Fourth Color)\" class=\"internal-link\">Fourth Color</a>\" energy, making him hard to detect or target by conventional Ætheric means.</p>"
